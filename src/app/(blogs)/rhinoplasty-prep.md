# How to Prepare for Rhinoplasty Without Surgery

Non-surgical rhinoplasty uses dermal fillers to improve nose shape without downtime.

## Before your appointment

1. Avoid blood thinners (if doctor allows)  
2. Avoid alcohol 24 hours before  
3. Come with clean skin (no makeup)

## What results look like
Most results are visible immediately and settle within a few days.
